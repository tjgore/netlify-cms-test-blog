<center>
People have secrets<br>
My secret is you<br>
Every poet has a story<br>
My story is you<br>
God gives gifts<br>
He gave me you<br>
Love is power<br>
My power is you<br>
Dreams are beautiful<br>
Beautiful is you<br>
Worldly desires<br>
My desire is you<br>
People seek love<br>
I seek you<br>
Words are few<br>
To describe you<br>
Magic is now<br>
Thanks to you<br>
Oh, mother<br>
Oh, father<br>
I love you<br>
All this is for you.
